Start your day with glory
Stay that way
Your story can not be written by someone else
Pump the dark
Black iron, like a shark
And with the eye of a tiger you’ll leave your mark
There’s no easy way out but you’ll make it someday, no doubt!
Deep in the night there’s a light shining from a burning heart with a spark to restart
While running up the hill you will feel like you’re winning the race and you will be
Victorious
A fool, never cool, like a tool, never glory, never fame, it’s the same kind of game
Until you feel the action, a glorified attraction
Of always going no pain, no gain
Back to start
You see a fire burning
That’s your heart
Your hearts on fire from the reps and you feel it now (gonna fly now)
As you enter through
The arena, what to do?
We will stand strong and united and always true
There’s no short cut home, just give it in, can’t be wrong, ’cause you know that you’re
strong
Deep in the night there’s a light shining from burning heart with spark to restart
While running up the hill you will feel like you’re winning the race and you will be
Victorious
A fool, never cool, like a tool, never glory, never fame. It’s the same kind of game
Until you feel the action, a glorified attraction
Of always going ”no pain, no gaining control”
