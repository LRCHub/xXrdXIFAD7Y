You want me near but not too close to feel your heart
How else am I to know you?
You act like you have seen a ghost when I mention love

Your heart spells out danger
'Cause you feel every man is the same when it comes to romance
Don't be no stranger to love just because
You've been hurt taking a chance

No pain, no gain
There's sunshine after the rain
No pain, no gain
I know that you feel the same

A never ending love, girl, if you let me belong to you
That's what you're gonna go through
You'll be forever catching your breath, we're long overdue

I've been holding back true passion
With a heart that aches to be real
Tell me how do you feel
Let's get into action
'Cause my words don't mean much
Unless you put them to use

No pain, no gain
There's sunshine after the rain
No pain, no gain
I know that you feel the same

This must be what love's all about
'Cause it feels so natural
Makes me feel that I can't do without
Don't ask the question if you don't believe
It's as simple as one, two, three
Sometimes the obvious is so hard to see
Like your true love, my mother gave birth to me

No pain, no gain
No pain, no gain
That's just the way it is

If you want something bad enough
You don't mind putting your heart into it
There's sunshine after the rain
No pain, no gain
I know that you feel the same
No pain, no gain
I love you girl
Can't change it
Can't do without you
Do you hear what I'm saying baby?
No pain, no gain
You've got the will, I've got the way
