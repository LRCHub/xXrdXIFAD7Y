You see the struggle before you
See the dark side of the street
You feel the friction of your heart and soul
And wonder if you're gonna take the heat

You wait for something to move you
Like fireworks that just appear
You reach for the power that will breach these walls
And nothing in the world will keep you here

Chorus:
If you got no pain, you got no gain
No pain, no gain
If you got no pain, you got no gain
No pain, no gain

Love is survival, so hold tight
You win and you lose but you still go on
Tears will strengthen you to understand
What matters when the tears are come and gone

I'm not a savior from heaven
Not an angel from the sky
It isn't easy in this crazy world
But something in you has to want to try

Chorus (repeat)
