One day I realized
I must apologize to myself
I broke the tower of stress
And filled my emptiness
With hope again
But still when I'm with you
It's cold as if winter time
Crawled into my room
I guess the problem is
That Winter People need the sun too
No pain no gain
So I take the southern train
While you're standing still
I kiss goodbye
You're so close - so far
Your love can still kill
I traveled all around the world
To the West and South
Searching for the peace of my soul
The South was cool and I
Stayed there for a while
My skin happily soaked the summer heat
But still while I was there
I found no one to share
All shadows and the light finding treasure:
My thoughts and my feelings
My sickness and my healing
From love I left behind in the North
No pain no gain
So I take the southern train
While you're standing still
I kiss goodbye
You're so close - so far
Your love can still kill
